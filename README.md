# ItsRainingRobots module
This is a module designed for the ItsRainingNeon community.

Must be used as a module for [Discoball](https://github.com/FlashyLights/Discoball)

## Config

This adds no new config settings.

## Extras

This also should be used with the BotWrangler and LogRedirect modules, which I will release shortly.
